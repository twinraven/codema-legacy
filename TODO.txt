TODO:

- error on leaving new company page, before saving
- save to dropbox/google drive (maybe Dropbox first, add G drive support later?)
- map
- map lat/long lookup
- auto-height for notes field


FUTURE:

- infinite scroll on company/contact list
- link contact from home page? (add #url-friendly uid to contacts in list on contacts page, add this fragment identifier to text for each company on homepage)
- type-ahead on 'contact' field
- add contacts section - allow central management of contacts, or creation of new one (from add/edit form -- should be implemented at the same time as autocomplete on the 'contact' field)
