TODO:

- add style difference between companies and contacts (so it's easy to tell them apart)
- set search field text colour (lighter) when inactive
- required fields
- form validation
- COMBINE COMPANY & CONTACT 'you've made changes' MESSAGES/UPLOADS?

- allow non-dropbox users to use the app (first visit: modal window: 'use dropbox', 'use local storage', 'ask me next time')
- handle dropbox error better (when the user refuses; etc)
- do better job of auto-populating contacts


FUTURE:

- auto-height for notes field
- Split dropbox data into table rows (not a JSON dump into 1 row)
- refactor CSS to BEM
- map
- map lat/long lookup
- infinite scroll on company/contact list
- add contacts section - allow central management of contacts, or creation of new one (from add/edit form -- should be implemented at the same time as autocomplete on the 'contact' field)
- link contact from home page? (add #url-friendly uid to contacts in list on contacts page, add this fragment identifier to text for each company on homepage)
