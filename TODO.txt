TODO:

- autocomplete for contact details fields on add/edit form
- refactor companiesService (split? Dropbox)



FUTURE:

- Split dropbox data into table rows (not a JSON dump into 1 row)
- refactor CSS to BEM
- auto-height for notes field
- map
- map lat/long lookup
- infinite scroll on company/contact list
- add contacts section - allow central management of contacts, or creation of new one (from add/edit form -- should be implemented at the same time as autocomplete on the 'contact' field)
- link contact from home page? (add #url-friendly uid to contacts in list on contacts page, add this fragment identifier to text for each company on homepage)
