TODO:

- on company form, in modal, clear fields on opening
- form validation
- add style difference between companies and contacts (so it's easy to tell them apart)
- required fields
- COMBINE COMPANY & CONTACT 'you've made changes' MESSAGES/UPLOADS?

- fix search: allow search by contact name in companies list



FUTURE:

- handle dropbox error better (when the user refuses; etc)
- allow non-dropbox users to use the app (first visit: modal window: 'use dropbox', 'use local storage', 'ask me next time')
- auto-height for notes field
- Split dropbox data into table rows (not a JSON dump into 1 row)
- refactor CSS to BEM
- map
- map lat/long lookup
- infinite scroll on company/contact list
