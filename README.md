## Features

#### Data saved in Dropbox Datastore

All data is saved in local storage, on the user's machine. If the user authenticates with Dropbox, then their data is also synced with a [Dropbox Datastore](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore) - meaning they can use the app anywhere & control the same data.
